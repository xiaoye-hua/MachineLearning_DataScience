## TODO & Questions

1. [x] side information -> supplement info such as 
    1. hotel attributes such as property type, star rating, 
    2. [ ] geospacial info (what kinds of??)
2. [x] how to eval impact? -> downstream recommendation problem
3. [ ] setting of embedding -> basic ideas
4. [x] how many data are used
    1. 1M hotels
    2. 60M click sessions
5. [ ] to read
    1. [ ] Real-Time Personalization Using Embeddings for Search Ranking at Airbnb 

## Problem Definition

1. [x] key metrics

## Previous Methods

1. Embedding only based on user-item interaction (click sequence)

## New Methods

1. Except user-item interaction, supplement, structure hotel information has been included

## Impacts

1. Most important advantage: addresses the cold-start problem for hotels with insufficient
historical click information by incorporating additional hotel attributes, which are available for all hotels.
    1. [ ] how???
        1. these hotels actually has no click info
        2. 
    2. [ ] test result -> better than click-session based solutions

## Further Improvement
